# AlphabetChecker
 
goofy app I made to train my C# skills. The operating principle is that you input a string, first part of which must start with letters in range from 'A' to 'E', then it can have (it can, but it's not necessary) an underscore sign '_' after this only letters in range from 'F' to 'Z' or only digits between '0' and '9'

firstly written in C++, then moved to C#. Made within 15 minutes. Why the hell C# can't return only one type of value ? :x 12.20.24
